## Overview

**AquaBloom Bottle Garden™** is a **sealed, low-maintenance miniature ecosystem** that brings **plants, fresh air, and pollinator support** into any space.  

Designed for **desks, windowsills, and small urban living areas**, each bottle uses a **condensation-based watering cycle** to sustain plants for weeks without care, while the **mycelium-carbon base** filters indoor air and promotes healthy growth.

---

## Core Features

- **Self-Watering System** – Condensation-driven cycle sustains plants for **2–4 weeks** without refills.  
- **Pollinator-Friendly Plants** – Nectar-producing microplants can be **opened outdoors** to feed bees and butterflies.  
- **Air Purification** – Mycelium-carbon substrate removes **CO₂, VOCs, and odors** from indoor air.  
- **Compact & Portable** – Fits on **desks, shelves, or windowsills**.  
- **Low Maintenance** – Needs only **monthly water/nutrient top-up**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Condensation Cycle** – Moisture evaporates, condenses on the bottle walls, and drips back down, **watering the plants naturally**.  
2. **Mycelium-Carbon Base** – Filters air, absorbs CO₂, and sustains soil health.  
3. **Nectar-Producing Microplants** – Supports pollinator health when opened to the outdoors.  
4. **Sealed or Ventilated Modes** – Functions as a closed terrarium or open-air microgarden.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Recycled glass or bioplastic bottle housing.  
  - Mycelium-carbon substrate for soil and air filtration.  
  - Nectar-rich plant varieties (hardy and low-light tolerant).

- **Production**:  
  - Produced via **existing terrarium and eco-product lines**.  
  - Production cost: **$10–$25 per unit**.  
  - Retail price: **$35–$80 per unit**, with optional refill kits.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Distributed via **eco-gift shops, garden centers, and online retailers**.
